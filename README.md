# Video-conference web and server

This project was build and sold to a company that wanted a video-conference solution for peer2peer (mesh) with STUN and TURN. It also scales over to a SFU when more than 2 participants are connected. It uses a MCU for audio. The backend is built with docker, so everything is containerized and scalable.
